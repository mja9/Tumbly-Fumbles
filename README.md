# Tumbly-Fumbles

Tumbly Fumbles is a JS game hosted on Surge. It was created as part of a week long individual project for the Web Development class at Rice University. Tumbly Fumbles was designed to display knowledge of JS events, storage, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

Tumbly Fumbles can be played at http://tumbly-fumbles.surge.sh/. The highest score I know of right now is 92. Good luck!
